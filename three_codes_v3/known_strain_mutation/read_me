(2) Install python3.6 or higher

(3) how to run

python known_strain_mutation.py --ref ref_file --known_strain_path input_file_path --output  output_path

example in my computer:

python /media/saidi/Elements/Project/Project17_mixtureS_from_Xin_orginal/latest/MixtureS/Ming/known_strain_mutation/known_strain_mutation.py --ref /media/saidi/Elements/Project/Project17_mixtureS_from_Xin_orginal/latest/MixtureS/Ming/known_strain_mutation/test_data/ref/ref.fna --known_strain_path /media/saidi/Elements/Project/Project17_mixtureS_from_Xin_orginal/latest/MixtureS/Ming/known_strain_mutation/test_data/known_strains --output  /media/saidi/Elements/Project/Project17_mixtureS_from_Xin_orginal/latest/MixtureS/Ming/known_strain_mutation/test_result
